Repository of Elena Manari for the course of machine learnng for physics and the natural sciences academic year 2022-2023
From the course I expect to learn and to learn about algorithms useful for solving machine learning problems also useful for my work, as well as deepen the themes of deep learning and NN, which interest me a lot.
